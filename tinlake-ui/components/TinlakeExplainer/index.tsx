          Tinlake is an open market place of asset pools bringing together Asset Originators and Investors that seek to
          utilize the full potential of Decentralized Finance (DeFi). Asset Originators can responsibly bridge
          real-world assets into DeFi and access bankless liquidity. Investors can earn attractive yields on different
          tokenized real-world assets such as invoices, mortgages or streaming royalties. Tinlakeâ€™s smart contract
          platform coordinates the different parties required to structure, administer and finance collateralized pools
          of these real-world assets.
