        Investors can invest into this Tinlake pool through two tokens that are backed by collateral locked by the Asset
        Originator: TIN and DROP. Both tokens represent the liquidity deposited into Tinlake and accrue interest over
        time. TIN, known as the “risk token,” takes the risk of defaults first but also receives higher returns. DROP,
        known as the “yield token,” is protected against defaults by the TIN token and receives stable (but usually
        lower) returns at the DROP rate.

        Please place your DROP and TIN investments and redemptions below. Tinlake pool investments and redemptions are
        locked in throughout the current “Epoch” and executed at the end of the Epoch based on available capital
        considering the pools risk metrics. You can cancel your order at any time until the end of the Epoch.
