 * Process to earn and claim rewards:
 * 1. User earns rewards on Ethereum for any investments on that Ethereum account `totalEarnedRewards`
 * 2. After holding a non zero investements for 30 (formerly 60) days, those rewards become claimable
 * 3. To claim rewards, user needs to link a Cent Chain account to the Ethereum account. If there is none, any rewards
 *    are in `unlinkedRewards`. If there is a link, rewards will be fully assigned to the (last) linked Cent Chain
 *    account.
 * 4. For those linked rewards to be claimable on Cent Chain, the amounts and balances (we call them together `claims`)
 *    are put once per day into a merkle tree, which's root will be stored on Cent Chain, and which's leaves will be
 *    uploaded to GCP into a storage bucket. Once the rewards are in the bucket and the root hash are stored on Cent
 *    Chain, they become claimable.
 * 5. User can now claim the rewards on Cent Chain.
 * 6. Claimed rewards can be queried from cent chain.
